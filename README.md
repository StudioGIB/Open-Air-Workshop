# Open Source Design - Fabrication 
We work on experimental design fueled by public support.
We strongly believe in a new way of doing Architecture, one in which we share with you the process and the results of our research, designs and builds.
All of GIB's projects are open-source. That is, during the development of any one project, all the content is hosted publicly on Github. We are also available via chat rooms on [Discord](https://discord.gg/3Qf9EzJqV9).

As we're mostly self-sustained, in order to keep our research free and running, we're on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/StudioGIB) too, where you can support us with your contribute.
