<p align="center">A minimal expansible garden workshop </p>

This projects is an attempt to build up a minimal lightweight workshop, to house tools and to work on small projects, with the capacity to extend, following a proper design intention, by modularity, mechanical ghizmos or tensile structures. The general idea is to design a minimal toolshed that transforms/morphs/rotates and unfolds into a proper indoor/outdoor workshop. All this, considering the optimal work environment for tools and raw materials (e.g. humidity), airflows, overall dimensions, feasability, material's aging and costs. 



# Brief

### Use : 
**1)** Small indoor workspace (2.5mx 2.5m) consisting of shelvings for tools, a wall workbench, air circulation unit (optional), storage box. 

**2)** capacity to expand the roofed space and occupy a larger area 2 to three times by frame (through roof expansion / tensile structures / mobile partitions ) and work around a proper worktable.
  This is mostly due to local (italian) regulations: there are strict constraints on what defines a building, ergo built volumes. 
  Thus the project will follow law constraints in order not to results as an additional new construction.

**3)** At least one removable/sliding/rotating partition in order to work on big sizes, circulate air 

**4)** Mechanical air extraction or adequate natural ventilation system.

### Energy : 
  **1)** Solar energy panels for lightning and/or for charging tools  
  
  **2)** Optional: Traditional Grid connection for power tools

### Cost 
**Cost limit capped at 5000 â‚¬**

### Materials and techniques

Cost, performance and origin of the materials will be taken highly in account. In order to stay in a 5k price cap we'll need to optimize the geometries and the tech used in order to protect the elements from the weather wear.
Standardization of the joints/frames is another goal. Ideally we'd like to "assemble" as many completed pieces on site as possible.
Transparent partitions will be an issue, since glass will be too expensive to be employed and Polycarbonate sheets performance are not stellar concerning temperature transmission and weathering.

# Open Source Design - Fabrication 
We work on experimental design fueled by public support.
We strongly believe in a new way of doing Architecture, one in which we share with you the process and the results of our research, designs and builds.
All of GIB's projects are open-source. That is, during the development of any one project, all the content is hosted publicly on Github. We are also available via chat rooms on [Discord](https://discord.gg/3Qf9EzJqV9).

As we're mostly self-sustained, in order to keep our research free and running, we're on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/StudioGIB) too, where you can support us with your contribute.
