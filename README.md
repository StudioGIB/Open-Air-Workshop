# About Open-Air-Workshop

A minimal expansible garden workshop

This projects is an attempt do build up a minimal lightweight workshop, housing tools and working on small projects, with the capacity to extend, following a proper design intention, by modularity, mechanical ghizmos or tensile structures. The general idea is to design a minimal toolshed that transforms/morphs/rotates and unfolds into a proper indoor/outdoor workshop. All this, considering the optimal work environment for tools and raw materials (e.g. humidity), airflows, overall dimensions, feasability, material's aging and costs 


# Brief

### Use : 
**1)** Small indoor workspace (2.5mx 2.5m) consisting of shelvings for tools, a wall workbench, air circulation unit (optional), storage box. 

**2)** capacity to expand the roofed space and occupy a larger area 2 to three times by frame (through roof expansion / tensile structures / mobile partitions ) and work around a proper worktable.

**3)** At least one removable/sliding/rotating partition in order to work on big sizes, circulate air 

**4)** Mechanical air extraction or adequate natural ventilation system.

### Energy : 
  **1)** Solar energy panels for lightning and/or for charging tools' batteries  
  
  **2)** Optional: Traditional Grid connection for power tools

### Cost 
**Cost limit capped at 5000 â‚¬**

# Open Source Design - Fabrication 
We work on experimental design fueled by public support.
We strongly believe in a new way of doing Architecture, one in which we share with you the process and the results of our research, designs and builds.
All of GIB's projects are open-source. That is, during the development of any one project, all the content is hosted publicly on Github. We are also available via chat rooms on [Discord](https://discord.gg/3Qf9EzJqV9).

As we're mostly self-sustained, in order to keep our research free and running, we're on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/StudioGIB) too, where you can support us with your contribute.
